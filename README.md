#scrambler

This is a code that will generate a random Rubik's cube scramble (using the random module), so that you make sure it is scrambled good next time you feel like solving one.
You first enter how long you want your scramble to be.
Then, all you have to do is press enter on your keyboard, and it prints out a scramble for you!
If you want to exit the program, simply type "exit", "quit", or "stop".
